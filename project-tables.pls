-- Project
-- UMBC Hotels Inc. (U.Hotels), is a fictitious hotel company. U.Hotels  is in need of upgrading its hotel management
-- system and has sought your help. Your team has been contacted by U.Hotels and you have signed a contract to help
-- them organize their office operations, using an Oracle database. You will code PL/SQL procedures and functions with
-- a number of operations that U.Hotels will be using to perform the day-to-day business with rooms, reservations etc.

-- U.Hotels is a typical hotel chain. Customers make reservations for specific dates and get specific services offered
-- by hotel (nights they stay, hotel restaurant, etc.) which they pay for when they check out.

-- Database Design
-- There are several types of information to be stored in the database on hotels in different cities operated by
-- U.HOTELS, customers, reservations, cancellations etc.

-- You are free to make your own design in the database and create your own tables. The following list outlines the
-- minimum information you should capture in the database. Feel free to add more tables and attributes if necessary to
-- support the office operations more effectively.
--
-- The database you will create will have information on hotels, such as Address, Phone, Room Types available, etc.
-- Customer information includes Name, Address, Phone, Credit Card, etc.
-- The most vital part of the database should be information on reservations.
-- It should include Client Name, Dates, Rate, Room Type, etc.
